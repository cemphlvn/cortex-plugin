# Ontology

## Rules

1. Structure = Ontology (filesystem IS knowledge graph)
2. Every folder: context.md + state.jsonl
3. Identity ≠ Location
4. Bootstrap before acting

## Agent Context

1. System Ontology (CORTEX.md)
2. Agent Identity (AGENT.md)
3. Location (context.md chain)
4. State (state.jsonl)
